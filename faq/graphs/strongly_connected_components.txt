        Strongly Connected Components (SCC) in Directed Graph

* Geeksforgeeks: Kosaraju’s algorithm to find SCC
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strongly-connected-components/

This algorithm is also found on ALGS4 and UCB "Algorithms" pdf book.

* Geeksforgeeks: Tarjan’s Algorithm to find SCC
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tarjan-algorithm-find-strongly-connected-components/

(This algorithm is very close to algorithms used to find bridge, AP, and BCC.)
