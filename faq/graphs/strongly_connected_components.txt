        Strongly Connected Components (SCC) in Directed Graph
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Geeksforgeeks: Kosaraju’s algorithm to find SCC
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strongly-connected-components/
(This algorithm is also found on ALGS4 and UCB "Algorithms" pdf book.)

* See this page on why the last node after topological sorting may not be a sink node:
http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Algorithms/MyAlgorithms/GraphAlgor/strongComponent.htm

In the first figure, one of the nodes in C2 has lowest post-order traversal value, but it is NOT
a sink node. So do a DFS on it will give incorrect SCC!

* Geeksforgeeks: Tarjan’s Algorithm to find SCC
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tarjan-algorithm-find-strongly-connected-components/

(This algorithm is very close to algorithms used to find bridge, AP, and BCC.)
