* Eulerian path (Eulerian trail): find a path that visits every edge in input graph 
exactly once. Can be solved in O(E+V).

UCB "Algorithms" book page 252: 
------------------------------------
The path can be found if and only if:
(a) The graph is connected;
(b) Every vertex, with the possible exception of two vertices (the starting and final
vertices of the walk), has even degree. 

* Eulerian cycle (Eulerian circuit, Eulerian tour): 
If starting and ending vertices are identical, Eulerian path becomes Eulerian cycle 

* For undirected graph, if each vertex has even degrees, each Eulerian path must be also 
Eulerian cycle. If only two vertices have odd degrees, they must be starting and ending 
vertices.

* In undirected graph, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE that only one vertex has odd degree. 
Proof: Each edge always connects two vertices. So adding one edge will increase the 
sum of each vertex's degree by 2. So the sum will be always an even number, no matter 
how many vertices an undirected graph has. 

* Other proberties on Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path
- An undirected graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if at most two vertices 
  have odd degree.
- A directed graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has equal 
  in_degree and out_degree.
- A directed graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if:
     at most one vertex has: (out_degree) - (in_degree)  = 1, 
     at most one vertex has: (in_degree)  - (out_degree) = 1, 

  every other vertex has equal in_degree and out_degree, and all of its vertices with 
  nonzero degree belong to a single connected component of the underlying undirected graph.

* Hierholzer's algorithm to find Eulerian cycle in undirected graph: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path
(1) Choose any starting vertex v, and follow a trail of edges from that vertex 
until returning to v. It is not possible to get stuck at any vertex other than v, 
because the even degree of all vertices ensures that, when the trail enters another 
vertex w, there must be an unused edge leaving w. The tour formed in this way is a 
closed tour, but may not cover all the vertices and edges of the initial graph.

(2) As long as there exists a vertex v that belongs to the current tour but that 
has adjacent edges not part of the tour, start another trail from v, following 
unused edges until returning to v, and join the tour formed in this way to the 
previous tour.

By using a data structure such as a doubly linked list to maintain the set of 
unused edges incident to each vertex, to maintain the list of vertices on the 
current tour that have unused edges, and to maintain the tour itself, the 
individual operations of the algorithm (finding unused edges exiting each vertex, 
finding a new starting vertex for a tour, and connecting two tours that share a 
vertex) may be performed in constant time each, so the overall algorithm takes 
linear time.

* Eulerian cycle in directed graph: ALGS4 book page 598, Excersize 4.2.20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
An Eulerian cycle is a directed cycle that contains each edge exactly once. 
Can be solve in polynomial time.

See solution in: Dropbox/coding/graph/DirectedEulerianCycle.java

The is actually the implementation of Hierholzer's algorithm on directed graph.

* dhu: to find Eulerian path in undirected graph that has two odd-degree vertices, 
we can find these two vertices first, then add one edge between them. This extra edge
makes all vertices have even degree. Then we find Eulerian cycle in this new graph, 
the Eulerian path in original graph will be the cycle minus extra edge. 

For a directed graph that has two vertices whose in-degree is not equal to out-degree, 
we can use the same idea to find Eulerian path.

* Euler tour is Problem 22-3 on CLRS 3rd edition, page 623.
Solution is available on Instruction Manual v2, pages 22-22 to 22-26.
The idea is same as the one on ALGS4.

* Geeksforgeeks: Fleuryâ€™s Algorithm to find Eulerian Path or Circuit in UNDIRECTED Graph (found in 1883)
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fleurys-algorithm-for-printing-eulerian-path/

The basic idea in this algorithm is "Never burn the bridge". But the C++ implementation is pretty dumb.
When seeing an unused edge, it always runs DFS to determine whether a certain edge is a bridge or not.
Instead, we can pre-calculate the bridges, then make a copy of the whole graph, and delete the edges that
have been used in the tour. See DirectedEulerianCycle.java (copied from ALGS4 website) for details. The time
complexity will be decreased from O((V+E)^2) to O(V+E).
