* Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find all pairs shortest path in a graph.

* The basic idea is Dynamic Programming, see UCB pdf (Chapter 6, pages 187-188).
The space complexity can be optimized from O(n^3) to O(n^2). See CLRS page 699,
25.2-4.

* epi.cpp is an implementation with the above optimization.
