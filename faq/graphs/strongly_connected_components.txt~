* Geeksforgeeks: Kosaraju’s algorithm to find SCC
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/articulation-points-or-cut-vertices-in-a-graph/

This algorithm is also found on ALGS4 and UCB "Algorithms" pdf book.

* Geeksforgeeks: Tarjan’s Algorithm to find SCC
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/articulation-points-or-cut-vertices-in-a-graph/

(This algorithm is very close to algorithms used to find bridge, AP, and BCC.)
