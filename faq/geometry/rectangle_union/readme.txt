According to slide #12, Jon L. Bentley's algorithm:
(1) use a plane-sweep algorithm;
(2) maintain the intersection intervals of rectangles and sweep line;
(3) maintain the length of the union of the intersection intervals;
(4) use an augmented semi-static segment tree for that purpose.
See slide #10 on "semi-static segment tree".
