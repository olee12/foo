The BEST tutorial I found online, covers segment tree and Jon Bentley's 
approach very well. 

According to slide #12, Jon L. Bentley's algorithm:
(1) use a plane-sweep algorithm;
(2) maintain the intersection intervals of rectangles and sweep line;
(3) maintain the length of the union of the intersection intervals;
(4) use an augmented semi-static segment tree for that purpose.

See slide #10 on "semi-static segment tree".

NOTE that to solve the rectangle union problem, Bentley actually uses 
a semi-static segment tree, which is different from what this webpage 
describes.

segment tree in this tutorial does NOT treat each starting and ending 
points as a seperate interval. This is different from many approaches 
in many other tutorials (such as Mark de berg's book and s4.pdf).

http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/99misc/SegmentTree.java.html
 "The SegmentTree class is an structure for efficient search of cummulative data.
  It performs  Range Minimum Query and Range Sum Query in O(log(n)) time.
  It can be easily customizable to support Range Max Query, Range Multiplication Query etc.
 
  Also it has been developed with "LazyPropagation" for range updates, which means when you
  perform update operations over a range, the update process affects the least nodes as
  possible so that the bigger the range you want to update, the less time it will consume
  to update it. Eventually those changes will be propagated to the children and the whole array
  will be up to date."
