---------
Given a set of rectangles along X and Y axises, calculate the perimeter of the
contour of the rectangle union. In other words, calculate the total length of
the "exterior edges" in the union of rectangles. (Any edge that is in overlapped
area should be excluded.)

For example, suppose we have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH. The top left corner of ABCD
is (1, 1), and bottom right corner is (3, 4); EFGH's top left corner is (2, 2), its bottom
right corner is (4, 5):

                  A(1,1)________ B(3,1)
                        |      |
                        |  E___|I__F       E: (2, 2)
                        |   |  |  |(4,2)   I: (3, 2)
                        |   |  |  |
                        |__K|__|J |        K: (2, 4)
                        D   |_____|G       J: (3, 4)
                      (1,4) H     (4,5)
                           (2,5)

  (In this coordinate system, X is increasing from left to right, Y is increasing from up to bottom.)

The perimeter of the contour will be:

    AB + BI + IF + FG + GH + HK + KD + DA = 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 14


Answer:
-------

This is a variant of Klee's measure problem in 2-d. Bentley's algorithm can calculate
input rectangle union's area in O(n * log n) time using an augmented segment tree.

We can use a varaint of Bentley's algorithm to solve this problem. In each node of the
segment tree, we store the following information:

  (1) start:             starting position of the segment;
  (2) end:               ending position of the segment;
  (3) contribution:      segment's contribution to the total distance in vertical direction;
  (4) rect_indexes:      indexes of input rectangles whose vertical range fully covers the current segment;
  (5) partition_counter: the number of unique partitions in vertical direction in current rectangle union.

(1), (2), (3) and (4) are also available in Bentley's algorithm to calculate the union's area;
(5) is a new field that is added specifically to solve the current problem.
For example, in the figure above, when we start to process the left edge of ABCD (AD), the number of unique
partitions in vertical direction is 1. The next point we process in X direction is EH, the left edge of EFGH,
because EH intersects with AD, the number of unique partitions in rectangle union is still 1.

This is the detailed procedure to calculate the perimeter of the contour:

int contour_perimeter = 0;

(1) When X[i] is the left edge of a rectangle, a new rectangle is being added into the union. We first update
    contribution and partition_counter in bottom-up fashion. (This is identical to Bentley's algorithm, except
    that now we need to update both contribution and partition_counter);

    X[i]'s contribution to contour perimeter in Y direction is the increment of root node's contribution:

                  contour_perimeter += root.contribution - original_root_contribution;

    The total contribution to contour perimeter in X direction in the range from X[i-1] to X[i]is:

                  contour_perimeter += (X[i] - X[i - 1]) * root.partion_counter * 2;

    (It is by 2 because each partition has upper and lower edges in X direction.)

(2) When X[i] is the right edge of a rectangle, this rectangle is exiting out of current rectangle union.
    We first save root.partition_counter as original_root_partition_counter, then update contribution and
    partition_counter in bottom-up fashion.

    X[i]'s contribution to contour perimeter in Y direction is the decrement of root node's contribution:

                  contour_perimeter += root.contribution - original_root_contribution;

    The total contribution to contour perimeter in X direction in the range from X[i-1] to X[i] is:

                  contour_perimeter += (X[i] - X[i - 1]) * original_root_partion_counter * 2;


DONE.
